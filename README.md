# htmx-tier

My take on a [Tier list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_list) app. I wanted
to also play around with the following technologies together:

* django
* htmx
* tailwind css

This setup leads to a minimal JS & CSS combo which I kinda enjoy.


# Installation

From a python virtualenv, install the requirements:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
